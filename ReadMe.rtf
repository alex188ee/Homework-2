I started the assignment by using one of our assignments from class as a base structure for my portfolio site. I first changed the navigation bar, using one that I found on bootstrap that I thought looked much better; I then centered the Navbar. I could not figure out how to align my name along with the other headers. I also could not figure out how to link my contact page in my index.html file. Added <meta> tag to help pages be responsive to different screen sizes. I will continue to work on this web page as I learn more and review previous videos so I will be able to use this portfolio moving forward.}
